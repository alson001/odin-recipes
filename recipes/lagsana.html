        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I like Swensens beef lasagna but there is little chance of me going there again.
           Food prices are exorbitant and with a tight budget it is just not possible for me to afford.
           This is a faster, and less expensive lasagna. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
                brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. 
                In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
