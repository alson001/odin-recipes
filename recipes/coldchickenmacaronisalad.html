        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 each skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced</li>
            <li>4 cups elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise, or more to taste</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add chicken; continue to boil until no longer 
                pink in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle, then dice into 
                small bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>While chicken cooks, bring a second large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow 
                macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 
                8 minutes. Drain and rinse under cool water.</li>
            <li>At the same time, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from
                heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove eggs from hot water and hold under cold running water to cool. Peel and dice eggs.</li>
            <li>Mix mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, onion salt, salt, mustard, and pepper together in a large bowl.
                Mix in diced eggs, pasta, and chicken, adding a little more mayonnaise if too dry. Chill for at
                lest 1 hour, or up to 8 hours or overnight before serving.</li>
        </ol>
