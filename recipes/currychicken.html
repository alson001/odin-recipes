        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Curry chicken is something that I will not stop craving. It has such a strong
           flavour with its spice. This coupled with the texture of the chicken is just impeccable.
           It has a little bit of heat, so probably do not serve to small children. Enjoy!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon yellow curry paste</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4½ teaspoons light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 (5.6 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, sliced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 potatoes - peeled, halved, and sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mash the yellow curry paste with about 2 tablespoons of chicken broth to help dissolve the paste;
                whisk in remaining chicken broth, sugar, curry powder, salt, light soy sauce, and coconut milk. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat for about 30 seconds; pour in the oil. Let the oil heat until shimmering,
                about 30 more seconds. Stir the chicken, garlic, and ginger into the hot oil; cook and stir until the chicken has begun 
                to brown and the garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the onion and potatoes, toss all ingredients in
                the hot oil, and pour in the sauce mixture. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat, and cover the wok. Simmer until the 
                chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
